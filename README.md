Sure, let's go through a dry run of the `numSteps` method from the `Solution` class step-by-step to understand how it converts a binary string `s` to "1" by performing the fewest number of steps, which involve either adding 1 to the binary number or dividing it by 2 (if it's even).

Here is the original method for reference:

```java
class Solution {
  public int numSteps(String s) {
    int ans = 0;
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);

    // All the trailing 0s can be popped by 1 step.
    while (sb.charAt(sb.length() - 1) == '0') {
      sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);
      ++ans;
    }

    if (sb.toString().equals("1"))
      return ans;

    // `s` is now odd, so add 1 to `s` and cost 1 step.
    ++ans;

    // All the 1s will become 0s and can be popped by 1 step.
    // All the 0s will become 1s and can be popped by 2 steps (adding 1 then
    // dividing by 2).
    for (final char c : sb.toString().toCharArray())
      ans += c == '1' ? 1 : 2;

    return ans;
  }
}
```

### Example Dry Run: `s = "1101"`

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Input `s` = "1101"
   - `ans` = 0
   - `sb` = new StringBuilder("1101")

2. **Removing trailing 0s**:
   - The last character of `sb` is '1', so we do not enter the while loop that removes trailing 0s.

3. **Check if `sb` equals "1"**:
   - `sb` ("1101") does not equal "1", so we proceed.

4. **Add 1 to `s`**:
   - Increment `ans` by 1: `ans` = 1

5. **Process remaining characters**:
   - Iterate over `sb.toString()` ("1101"):
     - '1' -> add 1 to `ans`: `ans` = 2
     - '1' -> add 1 to `ans`: `ans` = 3
     - '0' -> add 2 to `ans`: `ans` = 5
     - '1' -> add 1 to `ans`: `ans` = 6

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Return `ans` = 6

Let's break down the logic more intuitively:

- We first remove trailing zeros because dividing by 2 (which corresponds to removing trailing zeros in binary) is the simplest operation.
- After removing trailing zeros, if the remaining string is "1", we are done.
- If not, we account for adding 1 to make the number even if it's odd.
- Finally, we count the remaining steps needed for each bit:
  - For each '1', adding 1 turns it into '0' and then division by 2 (in a more abstract sense, considering the binary representation and simplification).
  - For each '0', flipping it to '1' and then removing it by division by 2 needs 2 steps.

### Example Step-by-Step for "1101":

- "1101" -> "1110" (adding 1 to 1101, which takes 1 step, now even, total steps = 1)
- "1110" -> "111" (divide by 2, which takes 1 step, total steps = 2)
- "111" -> "1000" (add 1 to 111, which takes 1 step, now even, total steps = 3)
- "1000" -> "100" (divide by 2, which takes 1 step, total steps = 4)
- "100" -> "10" (divide by 2, which takes 1 step, total steps = 5)
- "10" -> "1" (divide by 2, which takes 1 step, total steps = 6)

Thus, it matches our dry run result of 6 steps.
